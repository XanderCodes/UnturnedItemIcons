# Unturned Item Icons
A collection of squared and renamed icons from the game Unturned. For use with automated scripts and plugins.

This icon set was pulled from the Unturned/Extras/Icons folder, and run through a set of scripts to square the images (e.g. take a 500x350 image and make it 500x500) and to rename them to only contain their ID's (Such as renaming "Medkit_15.png" to just "15.png". This allows the raw image paths to be used by scripts and more notably, server plugins, but just calling the image URL, inserting the ID number, such as *add link in future*

# What this repository contains
The icons currently on this repo are, I kid you not, whatever the hell was in my Icons folder at the time. This includes some random items from various workshop mods, and for some reason, because of the way Unturned stores theese extra icons, a bunch of images for workshop content. No idea if that has any conflicts with ID's, but for the most part it seems fine.

# Folder Split (1000 file rule)
For some reason unknown, GitHub imposes a rule that you can only have up to 1000 files in a single directory. To combat this, the icons have been split between two folders. One for any items with ID's ranging 0-999, and another for 1000+. If a mass amount of icons are added in future, more categories and folders will need to be created.

This just means if you are pulling an icon, you will need to do a check to see if the item icon your grabbing has an ID under or over 1000.

# Contributing
Because this icon set was renamed and squared by scripts, I certainly have no gone through and checked that each item actually corresponds to the filename. If you find something that isn't right, feel free to fix it, or at the least just let me know. My Discord is AppleManYT#8750.
