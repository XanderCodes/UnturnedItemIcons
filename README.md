# Unnturned Item Icons
A collection of squared and renamed icons from the game Unturned. For use with automated scripts and plugins.

This icon set was pulled from the Unturned/Extras/Icons folder, and run through a set of scripts to square the images (e.g. take a 500x350 image and make it 500x500) and to rename them to only contain their ID's (Such as renaming "Medkit_15.png" to just "15.png". This allows the raw image paths to be used by scripts and more notably, server plugins, but just calling the image URL, inserting the ID number, such as *add link in future*

# Contributing
Because this icon set was renamed and squared by scripts, I certainly have no gone through and checked that each item actually corresponds to the filename. If you find something that isn't right, feel free to fix it, or at the least just let me know. My Discord is AppleManYT#8750.
